# Ndless Stealth CAS (based off r2021)
This fork of Ndless has been modified to:
- Hide the "CAS" text at the top of the homescreen in both Normal and Press-to-Test mode
- Restore the contents of "/documents/MyLib/*" folder during startup in Press-to-Test mode
- Exit Press-to-Test mode without a computer by pressing "Esc + T" (Exit Test) on the homescreen

## Requirements:
- TI-Nspire CX (Non-CAS preferably, but you can still use Press-to-Test bypass on a normal CAS calculator)
- A [nLoader CAS installation](https://tiplanet.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=21094&lang=en)
  - Tested on OS v4.5.5.79 and v4.5.3.14, use [my updated fork](https://github.com/SuleMareVientu/nLoader/releases/tag/v455) to disable the CAS warning
